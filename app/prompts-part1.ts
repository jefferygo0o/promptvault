Review the following code:

\`\`\`
<insert code here>
\`\`\`

Provide your response in three sections:

## 1. Critical Issues (must fix)
List any bugs, security vulnerabilities, or correctness problems. Reference line numbers and explain the failure mode. If there are none, say so explicitly.

## 2. Performance & Quality
Inefficiencies, anti-patterns, maintainability concerns. Suggest concrete improvements with reasoning.

## 3. Suggested Improvements
Polish: better naming, type safety, edge cases, test coverage. Optional, but worth doing.

Rules:
- No "this looks good!" openers
- If you're guessing, say so — don't fabricate issues
- Be specific. "Use a more efficient algorithm" is not advice.
- Cite the exact line where possible.`,

Bug: <describe — include observable symptoms and the environment>
Code path: <paste relevant code or the file hierarchy>
Logs / error messages: <paste>

Systematically:

1. **Form 3 hypotheses** for the root cause, ranked by likelihood.
2. **For the top hypothesis**, walk through the exact code path that produces the bug. Quote line numbers.
3. **The test that confirms or denies** each hypothesis. If you can write a 1-line script that proves it, do.
4. **The fix**: code change, plus a test that asserts the fix.
5. **The post-mortem**: what was the assumption that broke? How would we catch this class of bug earlier?

Codebase / feature: <describe>
Language: <TS / Python / Go / etc.>
Critical paths: <the parts that would hurt most if broken>
Existing tests: <count + sample>

Deliver:

1. **Testing philosophy** for this codebase. What we test relentlessly, what we don't.
2. **Test pyramid** for this feature (unit / integration / E2E) with counts.
3. **The 7 highest-value test cases**. Each: what it asserts, why this matters, the actual test code outline.
4. **3 tests NOT to write**, with reasoning (cost vs value).
5. **One flaky test** you suspect exists in the existing suite, even if you can't see it — based on common patterns.
6. **CI trade-off**: total runtime, fastest feedback, what runs on PR vs main.
7. **Most-missed test category** for this kind of code. Why people skip it, how not to.`,

System: <describe — components, data flow, infra>
Constraints: <scale target, latency budget, cost ceiling>

Read this as if you were the on-call:

1. **What scales badly?** Identify the 2-3 things that will hurt at the next stage. Be specific — name the component.
2. **The single root cause** of most future bugs in this design.
3. **The cost of overbuilding.** If the team removed 2 components, would users notice?
4. **The cost of underbuilding.** If the team added 1 critical component, what is it?
5. **Data model review**: hotspots, missing indexes, schema migrations that will hurt later.
6. **Failure modes**: cascading failures, retry storms, thundering herds, dropped events.
7. **Observability gaps**: if a user complains tomorrow that "it's slow," what telemetry does this design currently lack?
8. **The redesign** in 200 words. With reasoning. Don't propose a rewrite unless it earns it.

Must keep: <external API / behaviour / file structure>

Deliver:
1. **Refactored code** — clean, idiomatic, modern (ES2023+ where reasonable).
2. **Diff explanation** — what changed, why, with each non-obvious choice justified.
3. **Type tightening**: any any, unknown, unsafe casts — each with safer typing.
4. **Edge cases handled** that the original missed — list them.
5. **What to split out**: functions or modules that should now be their own file.
6. **Test delta**: 2-3 tests that should accompany the refactor, with pseudocode.
7. **One thing you didn't change** — and why.

High-level: the design choice. Explain non-obvious decisions. Reference the file paths reviewers should focus on.

- Unit: <list of tests, or "added N tests covering X">
- Manual: <steps to manually verify>

- Risk level + why
- Feature flag setup if any
- Rollback plan

What we're migrating: <describe — schema, API, framework, infra>
Scale: <rows of data, requests/sec, number of clients>
Risk: <how bad if this breaks; e.g. payments, login, reporting>

Deliver:

1. **Phased migration plan** — 3-5 phases. Each phase has: scope, success criteria, rollback strategy, time estimate.
2. **Dual-write approach** if data is involved — how to keep both systems consistent.
3. **Backfill plan** — how to migrate existing data, in what order, with what checks.
4. **Feature flag strategy** — what flag, who controls it, kill-switch design.
5. **Observability** — which metrics + alerts signal "this migration is going south."
6. **The canary group** — which % of traffic / customers first. Why that group.
7. **What I'd ship first to minimise risk** — even if it's not the most exciting: shadow reads, audit logs, back-button safety.
8. **The things that almost always go wrong** — and how to prevent them, not just detect.

Impact: <how many users, severity, blast radius>

Triage in this order:

1. **First 10 seconds** — what's the most likely cause? Look for: deploy in last 24h, dependency, config change, traffic spike.
2. **Reproduce in 60 seconds** — minimal repro or the closest experiment.
3. **Hypotheses ranked by likelihood**, not by fun-to-investigate.
4. **The mitigation right now** — first 5 minutes, not the perfect fix. Should we roll back? Disable the feature? Drain a queue?
5. **The real fix** — proper diagnosis + code change + test.
6. **A new guard rail** so this class of error doesn't recur. Possibly a code change, possibly an alert, possibly a feature flag.
7. **Customer comms** — what we tell users. If anything.
8. **Post-mortem skeleton** — blameless, focused on systems + decisions, not individuals. 1-page.

Distinguish "I know" from "I think." If it takes longer than 2 hours to root-cause, escalate — and propose two parallel investigation tracks.`,
