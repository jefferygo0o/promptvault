Product/page: <describe>
Audience: <who>
Promise: <the single outcome they want>

Generate 10 headline options. For each:
- The headline (max 9 words)
- A short rationale (why it works, what emotion/proof it uses)
- A risk note (what could make it flop)

Then rank them 1–10 by expected conversion rate for a cold audience.

Avoid clickbait, vague benefit claims. Specific > clever.`,

Product: <describe in 1 sentence>
Customer: <who>
Main promise: <the single outcome>
Proof available: <testimonials, numbers, logos>
Price: <free / $X / custom>

Build the landing page:

**Above the fold**
- Headline (outcome, sub-15 words)
- Subhead (who it's for + how it works in 1 breath)
- Hero CTA button text
- Suggested image/visual

**Below the fold**
- 3-sentence "how it works"
- 3 benefit blocks (each: outcome + how + why it matters)
- Social proof section (placeholders if needed)
- Testimonial section (sample questions to ask)
- Objections answered (3)
- Pricing/comparison section if relevant
- Final CTA block
- FAQ (5 questions, real objections)

Then suggest 2 A/B tests to run first.`,

Recipient: <name, role, company>
What we offer: <one line>
Specific pain we solve for them: <describe, ideally with research>
Trigger event (optional): <funding round, hire, post, complaint, etc.>
Goal: <reply, demo booking, conversation>

Build 2 versions:

**Version A: Direct (under 90 words)**
- Subject line
- First line — observation about their world, no flattery
- One line about us, very tight
- One clear ask
- Sign-off

**Version B: Looped (a small story opening)**
- Subject line
- Opening: a specific "we noticed X" or "we just saw Y"
- Bridge to relevance
- Soft ask (just a question)

Rules:
- No "Hope this finds you well"
- No "I noticed you're in [industry]"
- No "Just touching base"
- Maximum 1 link, ideally 0
- Short — assume they read on phone
- Specific > clever

Also: 2 follow-up emails (3, 7 days after no reply). Each one short. Each one adds new value, doesn't just "bump."`,

1. **Channel mix** — what's worth my time for a 0-budget launch. Tier them.
2. **Day-by-day timeline from T-14 to T+7**
3. **Specific posts / content** — give me 5 actual post drafts (twitter, linkedin, blog headline + outline, HN-style post, etc.)
4. **Who to email / DM** — and a template for each type of recipient (indie hackers, friends, podcast hosts, journalists, existing users)
5. **Communities to post in** — specific names, posting rules, timing
6. **KPI targets** for the week — realistic based on audience size
7. **If it flatlines** — what's the one experiment you'd try first

No vague advice ("post on socials"). Concrete, executable actions.`,

3. **Trigger moment** — when do you show the referral prompt? Be specific to user actions.
4. **Where it lives in product** — 2-3 places, with rationale.

Deliver:
